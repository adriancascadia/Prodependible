## VISUAL IDENTITY

### Photography Style

Dependable Home Improvement's visual identity relies heavily on authentic project photography that demonstrates real work, real results, and real craftsmanship.

**Photography Principles:**

**Authenticity Over Perfection**
Use actual project photos rather than stock imagery. Real before/after transformations build more credibility than staged professional photography.

**Well-Lit & Clear**
All photos should be well-lit with natural or supplemental lighting. Avoid dark, grainy, or unclear images that don't showcase quality work.

**Detail Shots**
Include close-up photography that highlights craftsmanship details: clean corners, smooth finishes, precise cuts, quality materials.

**Context & Scale**
Show full room or project views that provide context and help prospects visualize transformations in their own spaces.

**Human Element**
Include occasional photos of the team at work (with proper safety equipment) to humanize the brand and build connection.

### Imagery Guidelines

**Before/After Photography:**
- Same angle and lighting for both photos
- Clear labels: "BEFORE" and "AFTER"
- Side-by-side presentation for immediate visual impact
- Include brief description of work completed
- Highlight specific improvements and transformations

**Project Photography:**
- Capture multiple angles of completed work
- Include detail shots of quality finishes
- Photograph in natural daylight when possible
- Ensure spaces are clean and staged appropriately
- Remove clutter and personal items

**Team Photography:**

- Workshop and office environment shots
- Action shots of team working on projects

**Facility Photography:**
- Clean, organized workshop spaces

- Quality materials and supplies
- Organized storage and staging areas

### Before/After Presentations

Before/after galleries are the most powerful marketing tool for home improvement services. Proper presentation is critical:

**Side-by-Side Layout:**
Present before and after images next to each other, not as sliders or overlays. This allows immediate visual comparison without interaction.

**Consistent Framing:**
Take before and after photos from the exact same position and angle. This emphasizes the transformation rather than photographic differences.

**Clear Labeling:**
Always label images clearly as "BEFORE" and "AFTER" to avoid confusion.

**Project Details:**
Include brief description of work performed, timeline, and key improvements. Help viewers understand what changed and why.

**Variety:**
Showcase diverse project types: decks, bathrooms, kitchens, basements, exteriors, carpentry, painting. Demonstrate full range of capabilities.
