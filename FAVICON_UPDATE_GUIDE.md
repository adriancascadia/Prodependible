# Favicon Update Guide

This guide explains how to update your website's favicon to match your company logo for complete brand consistency.

## What is a Favicon?

A favicon is the small icon that appears in browser tabs, bookmarks, and browser history next to your website name. It helps users quickly identify your site among multiple open tabs.

## Where to Update the Favicon

The favicon is **not controlled by the code** in this project. Instead, it's managed through the **Management Dashboard** in the user interface.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Access the Management Dashboard

- Click the **settings icon** (⚙️) in the top-right corner of the chatbox header
- This opens the Management UI panel on the right side of the screen

### 2. Navigate to Settings

- In the Management UI, look for the **Settings** section in the left sidebar
- Click on **General** to access general website settings

### 3. Upload Your Favicon

- Scroll down to the **Favicon** section
- Click the **Upload** or **Choose File** button
- Select your logo file (preferably a square PNG or SVG file)
- Recommended size: **512×512 pixels** or larger for best quality
- The system will automatically resize and optimize it for use as a favicon

### 4. Save Changes

- Click **Save** or **Update** to apply the new favicon
- The change will take effect immediately on your published site

## Best Practices

**File Format:**
- PNG or SVG formats work best
- ICO format is also supported for maximum compatibility

**Image Requirements:**
- Use a **square image** (1:1 aspect ratio)
- Minimum size: 512×512 pixels
- Maximum file size: 2MB
- Simple, recognizable design works best at small sizes

**Design Tips:**
- Avoid fine details that won't be visible at 16×16 or 32×32 pixels
- Use high contrast colors
- Consider how the icon looks on both light and dark backgrounds
- Test how it appears when scaled down to very small sizes

## Current Logo Location

Your actual company logo is stored at:
```
/logo-actual.svg
```

You can use this same file for the favicon, or create a simplified version specifically optimized for small icon sizes.

## Troubleshooting

**Favicon not updating in browser?**
- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete or Cmd+Shift+Delete)
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Close and reopen the browser
- Check in an incognito/private browsing window

**Icon looks blurry?**
- Upload a higher resolution image (at least 512×512)
- Use PNG or SVG format instead of JPG
- Ensure the original image is sharp and not already pixelated
